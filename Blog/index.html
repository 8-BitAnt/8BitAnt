        <h3>I was very overwhelmed Sunday...</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>I just woke up to a message from Tyro on Instagram saying someone posted my 3DMM animation, then later on I check NewGrounds, and TomFulp (the creator of NewGrounds) himself followed me. Once I saw my post it said that it was front paged, and I thought that was really cool! The Official NewGrounds account posted it on Twitter too!  </p>
